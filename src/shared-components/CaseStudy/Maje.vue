        During 1 year I worked as a freelance for Maje France. It was a great experience because I worked directly with the client. Before the season to come, I had a meeting at the Paris Maje headquarter with the digital creative team. They presented the design of the pages and we discussed the interactions that we had in mind. You can see some of them below.
